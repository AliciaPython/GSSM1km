Global Surface Soil Moisture (GSSM1km) provides surface soil moisture (0-5 cm) at 1 km spatial and daily temporal resolution over the period 2000-2020. The performance of the GSSM1km dataset is evaluated with testing and validation datasets, and via inter-comparisons with existing soil moisture products. The root mean square error of GSSM1km in testing set is 0.05 cm3/cm3, and correlation coefficient is 0.9. 
To reproduce GSSM1km using the code files in this repository. The training, testing, validating and evaluating data is public.
