Global Surface Soil Moisture (GSSM1km) provides surface soil moisture (0-5 cm) at 1 km spatial and daily temporal resolution over the period 2000-2020. The performance of the GSSM1km dataset is evaluated with testing and validation datasets, and via inter-comparisons with existing soil moisture products. The root mean square error of GSSM1km in testing set is 0.05 cm3/cm3, and correlation coefficient is 0.9. 
To reproduce GSSM1km using the code files in this repository. The public data I already made them accessible. If you run my code, it will automatically access them. 
The training, testing, validating and evaluating data is public. 
Topographic Index (TI), Depth To Bedrock (DTB), Water Table Depth (WTD) is public.
